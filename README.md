## Grecify App
#### What is this project?
This project is a fun little thing I made in 2022. The same year I created my first little NPM package - [`grecify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grecify?activeTab=readme), just to try how to create and upload a package to NPM. 

And when I did that, I also wanted to try it out in a "3rd party" setting. So I made a simple React web application that utilizes the `grecify` package.

The application allows you to transform the text you put it into a "Greek" version, meaning the letters are replaced by their Greek alphabet counterparts. 

**IMPORTANT:** The conversion is <ins>NOT</ins> done based on grammar or any other rules. The package just replaces latin alphabet letters for their Greek alphabet matches (e.g. letter 'a' is replaced by the letter alpha).

#### Deployment
This application is a small little fun project and should not be taken seriously. But if you want to check it out, it is available [here](https://grecify.netlify.app/).
